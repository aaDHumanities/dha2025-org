## Digital Archipelagos

Digital Humanities Australasia 2025, 2-5 December Australian National University, Canberra (Ngambri)

Digital Archipelagos is a four-day interdisciplinary Digital Humanities conference held on the lands of the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people at The Australian National University, hosted by the HASS Digital Research Hub and the College of Arts and Social Sciences. The main conference will run from midday on 3 December, with pre-meetings, workshops and allied events on 2 December, including the Canadian Australian Partnership for Open Scholarship (CAPOS) gathering.

The conference will draw on environmental and cultural dynamics to investigate the ethics of collecting, studying, and preserving digital cultural heritage. It will also highlight Indigenous data practices and sustainable approaches to the Digital Humanities. We frame sustainability not just as a technical concern, but as a ‘multifaceted activity’ across environmental, political, cultural, and artistic domains.
