The DHA2025 theme is Digital Archipelagos. The Australasian region is home to myriad archipelagos with deep significance, from the Kulkalgal Nation islands in the middle of Torres Strait to the Wharekauri (‘Misty Sun’) archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, east of Aotearoa’s South Island. Diverse, sacred, and yet increasingly under threat, these sites offer powerful examples of how land and sea are woven into cultural knowledge systems, social relations, and identities.

Archipelagos also serve our conference as a metaphor to spark dialogue about new directions and approaches in the Digital Humanities. They inspire us to conceptualise the fragmentation, clustering, dispersion, and interconnection of data in the Digital Humanities in discussions that prioritise local experiences and networks to challenge dominant narratives. In an age of algorithmic ubiquity, we aim to examine how seemingly isolated ‘islands’ of knowledge can remain distinct but intricately connected across evolving global contexts.

Like the diverse archipelagos that inspire our theme, we seek to engage the DH community around new topics and pathways, with papers and workshops from the wider arts, humanities, social sciences. We welcome contributions from scholars, librarians, archivists, artists, writers, practitioners, performers, activists, and others engaged with the intersections of Digital Humanities, sustainability, and social justice. We especially encourage submissions that propose novel, interdisciplinary frameworks and methods in DH and cognate fields.

## We invite contributors to address the conference theme through the following three themes:

### 1. AI-Enhanced Humanities Research
- AI and artistic practice, cultural value, and labour
- Policy and consent in the automation of cultural data
- AI and/in humanities pedagogy and education
- Emerging AI tools and cultures in DH
- Critiques of computational tools and methodologies
- Responsible AI as Public Humanities
  
### 2. Digital Cultural Stewardship
- Data connections, silos, fragmentations, bridges, and clusters
- Digital narratives and situated, embodied storytelling
- Metadata, data schema, data architectures
- Collections-as-Data
- Co-design in the Digital Humanities
- New approaches in GLAM (e.g. collaboration with researchers)
- Research Software Engineering (RSE) roles & responsibilities
- Mapping, geospatial tools, and language networks
- Collaborative research projects & Critical Infrastructure Studies (CIS)
- Digital curation and stewardship
  
### 3. Data Ethics and Inclusive Practice
- Decolonial DH, engagement, and inclusiveness principles
- Climate, cultural heritage, and responsible digital preservation
- Indigenous/community data protocols
- Frameworks for cultural care
- Data justice, digital empowerment, resistance
- Geography and fieldwork in DH
- Environmental Digital Humanities
- Cultural flows, diasporic communities, trans-oceanic exchange
